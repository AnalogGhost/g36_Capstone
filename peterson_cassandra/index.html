<h2>About my Project: Bag Tags</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<div class="">
  Bag Tags is a site for disc golfers to trade their bag tags. Bag tags are given out at tournaments or are sold for fundraisers. Each one has a number on it, the lower the number the better the tag.
  <br>
  Currently there is no way to track who has which tag, until now. This app will be a way to track what tags you have and had as well as communicate with people who have the same bag tag as you.
