    <h1>Musical Discovery Site and Planning App</h1>
    <p>My project is a musical discovery and planning app for festival
      attendees and organizers to use.  The site will have performers in one
      centralized place.  The user can discover a musician that will be at
      the festival using the soundcould and youtube api.  Users can suggest
      specific songs or albums to check out for each artist.  Users can plan which
      events they would like to attend during the festival and build their own
      personalized itinerary.
      </p>

    <p>the technologies I would like to use are:  React Native (mobile first), PHP, Laravel, SQL
       (looking to get PHP experience for employment purposes)</p>

    <p>Once MVP is reached, I would like to add 'discover workshops' with ability to pin a
       workshop to your personal itinerary, community festival checklist, where attendees can contribute,
       and a general discussion page for categories of music, workshops, yoga, special events.</p>
