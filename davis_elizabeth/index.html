<h3>Capstone Proposal</h3>
<p>I would like to create an application called "Mandala", which helps people assess how effective their community/social network is in their lives. </p>
<h3>Functionality:</h3>
<p>To create this application I will be using an established assessment tool used for social mapping by a Boulder based company called JSAT, a research organization that asseses the clinical effectiveness of motivational interviewing within the criminal justice system. The application will use social media such as Facebook and Linkedin to analyze the quality and diversity of a user's social network and greater community (based on survey questions filled out by the user), and then provide a graphed visualization of the data provided by the assessment as a result. This could be used by JSAT in a clinical setting, and could also be marketed to other types of organizations who might want to provide feedback to their employees about the effectiveness of their community and social network. </p>
<h3>I am considering the following technologies:</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <ul>Angular 2 (unfamiliar)</ul>
    <ul>Bootstrap</ul>
    <ul>D3 (for the graphed data, unfamiliar)</ul>
    <ul>Linkedin/Facebook API (unfamiliar)</ul>
    <ul>PostgreSQL</ul>
    <ul>Express</ul>
  </ul>
</p>
