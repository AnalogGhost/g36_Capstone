    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>My name is Matthew Lindly! I've studied Computer Science, application development, and now have nearly completed Galvanize's Full Stack Web Development course. After learning such a broad array of programming languages, my ability to pick up and adapt
      my current knowledge to a new language has greatly improved. Galvanize has been a wonderful experience for me, and I can't wait to see what the future holds! </p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">About the Project</h3>

    <p>My idea involves a "Smart Alarm Clock" concept that I also pitched for the Q3 project here at Galvanize. I've been wanting to become intimate with the concept of mobile application development for a while now, resulting in my interest in this project.
      The background of the idea comes from people's constant need to improve their time management, and the alarm clock would do the following things: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be able to set up a standard alarm.</li>
      <li>Be able to preset your locations the night before.</li>
      <li>Adjust that alarm based on your destinations' morning/early afternoon traffic.</li>
      <li>Ensure you're never late to your important meeting, sales pitch, or first day of work/school again!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, as mentioned, it will be able to have preset destinations created the night before by users, this could be a boyfriend/girlfriend's house, a school, a place of work, or really any destination that a user needs to reach in the morning. After setting
      the destination, and setting their alarm, the alarm will wake up the user "X" amount of time before their pre-set alarm based on the traffic to their destination. This will help them make it to the meetings, first day of school, or the sales pitch
      and make it on time.</p>
