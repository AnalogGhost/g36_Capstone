    <h2>My Proposal</h2>
    <p>For my capstone proposal I would like to obtain real world experience. Ryan Kane is subconstracting  a freelance project.  I would be working on an application called lazybuffs.   I would be translating all the react to react native, in order to have real time updates on the map component of the application lazybuffs.  </p>
