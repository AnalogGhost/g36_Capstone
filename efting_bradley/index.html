    <h3>Capstone Idea</h3>

    <p>My wife, Selena, has her dream job as a physical therapist at a top ten brain and spinal cord injury hospital in the nation. Her main focus is working with patients with spinal cord injuries and she also works in the NeuroRecovery Network (NRN) program. The NRN program requires patients to submit applications to see if they are a good fit. For additional information about how this form of therapy is beneficial, I'll turn to the experts. (for my app, my wife has volunteered to help with the content and will proofread the medical jargon)</p>
    <p>According to Craig Hospital <em>"The NRN physical therapy program utilizes locomotor training as its primary intervention to stimulate the nervous system and drive motor recovery. Locomotor training (LT) is an activity based therapy designed to activate spinal pathways below the level of injury through manually facilitated step retraining over a body weight supported treadmill. By manipulating variables such as speed and body weight support, the therapists can challenge the patientâ€™s nervous system in efforts to improve trunk control, posture, strength, independence, and in some cases return of ability to walk"</em> (Craig Hospital, 2016).</p>
    <p>The reason why I have introduced Selena and the NRN program is that all patients that want to be apart of the program have to fill out an application to determine if they are a good fit. Currently, the applications are accepted from users using a keyboard. For my capstone project, I would like to create a Bot that would accept user input using speech recognition and/or input from a keyboard. The Bot would be accessed through my web app and I would also create a Bot on FaceBook for my phony rehab center. Since I was taught how to build full-stack apps, my stretch goal is to create a full-stack app for the rehab center so that the applicant's information is stored in a database. I understand that since my app is for the medical field, it would have to meet HIPA standards. Since I am limited on time, this app won't be built to meet HIPA standards so I will inform the users that HIPA standards are not met and if this app ever goes into production, HIPA standards will be met.</p>

    <p>The unfamiliar environment for this app is the Bot and Speech recognition. I don't know if I am going to use Alexa for the speech recognition or another API.</p>
