        <h4>Greetings from the Internet is an original project by Anna Lotko. She designed and developed it as her capstone project for the Boulder Galvanize Full-Stack Web Development program. The project started out as a simple 1-week static site. The original site can be found by <a href="http://greetingsfromtheinternet.surge.sh/">clicking this link.</a> After spending a few months leveling up her web development skills, Anna decided to embark on the adventure of creating a full-stack version of the project.</h4>

              <h4>Step 1: Theme Selection</h4>
              <p>We have carefully crafted 4 different themes to choose from. Each theme includes different customization assets that will give a different visual identity to your postcard.</p>

              <p>I encountered difficulties when I sought to merge user settings with HTML templates on a NodeJS server before pushing all data to the Lob API. Lob is great (!!) but very particular about the format in which it receives data. Each SVG frame is a different template. When users make adjustments to their design in the image composition page of the tool, these settings get pushed as key value pairs to my server. The server then handles the logic for how the data gets interpolated into the HTML custom templates.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Dynamic layouts were a challenge. There is a tension between wanting to give the user ultimate control over the aesthetic of the postcard and keeping the settings limited for content management reasons. The site strikes a nice balance between allowing for customization and variety while still presenting a consistent aesthetic across the different themes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>The site marries modern web-design with an old-world aesthetic. I developed a visual language for the site that uses modern, responsive design while making the user feel like he or she is in Wes Anderson's living room. One of the greatest challenges of this design was to give the site character while preventing it from conflicting with postcard themes that the user can select. Ultimately the site feels fresh and user friendly but it is quite distinct.</p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>This site was made in 2-weeks! While most of the assets are originals, I did end up using a few assets from Creative Market due to project deadlines. Given the unique nature of the front end design and the robust back end that supports the postcard creation tool, I've very proud of how it turned out.</p>
