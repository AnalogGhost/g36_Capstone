  <h1>Picture search</h1>
  <p>Using SWIFT for my unfamiliar environment I would create an app that let the users take a photo and have relevant information returned about what is in the picture. More specifically if you took a picture of a business logo the app would analyze the picture and send you back the name of the organization, possible locations, and general information about the organization. You would also be able to get information back about landmarks and nature. This app begins to bridge the gap between augmented reality and the apps we use today. Instead of typing something into google to learn about it with Picture search you look around you, take a picture of something you want to know more about, and without typing you are able to learn something new. I would connect to the Google vision API to understand the images and then possibly other API's to get more information about the picture</p>

  <h1>Advanced Chriopratic</h1>
  <p>Advanced Chiropractic is a local business in fort collins. I have been in negotiations with them in regards to building their website. The big plus of this idea is once created my project will be an active businesses website. The main parts of my pitch to Advanced Chiro was online scheduling and a mini store that would allow them to sell small items through facebook. I would be rebuilding their website from top down so i will have my choice of technologies.</p>

  <h1>Blogs</h1>
  <p>I’m interested in making blogs in my spare time either with me as the content provider or just making the website for a customer. I have two blogs in mind one to do with baking, and the other hiking and the great outdoors. I would like to learn more about the pros and cons of using wordpress to build my blog. Therefore i would build one blog with the MEAN stack and the other using wordpress, javascript, and whatever else it takes. I believe this would give me a chance to show to other prospective clients i have the versatility to make their website however they would prefer. I could use any number of API’s to make the sites more interesting such as a quote of the day API or even an API for different outdoorsy pictures for the great outdoors blog.</p>
