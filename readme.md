# G36 Capstone Presentations

I have created this common repo so we can submit information related to the capstone.

Each student should fork and clone this repo.  In your directory please create a simple static webpage with the following sections:

- [ ] About Me
      - [ ] Simple bio
      - [ ] Contact Links
      - [ ] Links to social media (LinkedIn, Github, etc)
- [ ] About My Project
      - [ ] Simple description
      - [ ] Technologies Used
      - [ ] Links (Repo, deployments, etc.)

This link will be shared throughout Galvanize and beyond so please take it seriously.  You are free to include more information.  For example, **Teddi** had a journal that described her development process with her capstone.

**Important**

The entire site needs to be finished by capstone presentation day. 

To start we need a site submitted with a description of your project and the technologies you plan to use. 

Please submit a pull request when you want an instrutcor to review your site.
