      <div>
        <p>My name is Brad Chapin. Thank you for visiting my page, and for your interest in my project proposal.</p>
        <p>A bit about me: I'm a full stack web developer, soon to be a Galvanize WDI graduate, and a game nut. I hope to be able to leverage my experience as a gamer and my freshly-honed skills as a programmer and a designer into a career of designing, making, and, of course, playing games.</p>

      About my Project...
    </h1>
    <div>
      <p>Back in the early 80's, a simple game was released called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_(computer_game)">Robots</a>. It spawned several different versions and clones, including the one I encountered in the late 80's called Daleks, and I've loved the game ever since.</p>
      <p>My intention is to create a newer, more modern looking version of the game, reskinned with art assets produced by my favorite artist (who also happens to be my wife). My re-imagining of this classic will be created with the usual suspects of HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript, alongside the unusual suspect of the HTML framework <a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser.</a></p>
